AcidarX
=======

AcidarX (a.k.a AX) is a modular Game Framework, built with C# and SILK.NET. It is aiming to be a complete package for game developers, who prefer to write code instead of using ui tools, but also usable as separate modules (For example, you can use `AcidarX.ECS` in your own game framework/engine which uses MonoGame).

> :warning: **Currently under development**: It has not even hit alpha stage yet, and all the previously claimed 'modularity' will probably come really later.
